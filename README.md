# Pizza Cream
This is an app I built to simulate cash registers at a Pizza & Ice Cream shop.  The user first selects whether or not they want pizza or ice cream and then they are given options for their order.  This was an excercise in practicing angular factories.
## Setup Instructions:
```
Clone repository and open the index.html file.
```
